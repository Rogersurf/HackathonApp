# AAUBS Data Science 2023 - Dashboard Hackathon Submission
### Hello there! We're thrilled to present our dashboard submission for the hackathon event, part of the AAUBS Data Science course in 2023.

# About the Hackathon
### On the 12th, AAUBS kick-started a challenge that blended both the intricacies of data science with the aesthetic requirements of frontend development. We were tasked with the engaging challenge of creating an intuitive and engaging dashboard. The tool of our choice? Streamlit. With the datasets provided by the organizers, our mission was to delve deep into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and surface with insights that not only inform but also inspire.

### The goal wasn't just to dissect the dataset; it was about bringing those data points to life in a format that is interactive, user-friendly, and insightful.

# About the Course
### The AAUBS Data Science course at Aalborg University Business School is a rigorous program tailored to cultivate the next generation of data enthusiasts. This program doesn't just teach syntax; it instills a data-driven mindset. Through events like this hackathon, the course challenges students to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, ensuring that we're not just proficient with tools and techniques, but also adept at problem-solving and critical thinking.
